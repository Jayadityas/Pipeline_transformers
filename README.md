# Pipeline_transformers
Overview

This project delves into the fundamental workflow of transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. It demonstrates how transformers process text data, from tokenization to model inference, showcasing the capabilities of state-of-the-art language models.

Features

1. Tokenization: Preprocessing text data using subword tokenization techniques.

2. Transformer Model Utilization: Implementing pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and T5.

3. Text Classification: Analyzing sentiment and categorizing text-based inputs.

4. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting key entities from text.

5. Text Generation: Demonstrating sequence-to-sequence learning for generating coherent text outputs.

6. Fine-tuning Transformers: Training models for domain-specific tasks.
